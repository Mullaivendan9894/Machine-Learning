# Walmart Weekly Sales Forecast Project

## üìù Problem Statement

### **Objective:**
The goal of this project is to predict the weekly sales for different Walmart stores based on historical sales data, holidays, and various economic factors (temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rates). By accurately forecasting weekly sales, Walmart can optimize inventory management, staffing, and promotional activities to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### **Key Challenges:**
- The dataset contains weekly sales data over multiple stores and dates, with potential seasonal trends and holiday effects.
- Various factors such as temperature, fuel price, and unemployment may influence sales patterns differently across stores.

### **Business Value:**
- **Inventory Optimization:** Accurate forecasts help avoid overstocking or understocking.
- **Staff Planning:** Aligning workforce schedules with predicted demand.
- **Promotion Management:** Timing promotions to maximize impact during high-demand periods.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reducing operational costs by anticipating demand fluctuations.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Development Plan

### üìä 1. Data Understanding and Exploration

#### **Dataset Overview:**
Understand the structure, types, and completeness of the data.

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Explore trends, patterns, correlations, and outliers. Key areas of exploration:
- Trends in weekly sales over time.
- Impact of holidays on sales.
- Influence of temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.
- Store-wise and seasonal sales patterns.

### üßπ 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

#### **Handling Missing Values:**
Ensure no missing values exist or impute them appropriately.

#### **Feature Engineering:**
- Create new features like Year, Month, Week, Day, and `IsHoliday` (boolean).
- Lag features: Add previous week's sales as an additional predictor.

#### **Scaling and Normalization:**
Standardize continuous features (temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment) if required.

#### **Train-Test Split:**
Use an 80-20 split while maintaining the chronological order for time series models.

### üß† 3. Model Selection

We will use a combination of **time-series forecasting models** and **machine learning models** to predict weekly sales.

#### **Time-Series Models**

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):**
   - Good for univariate time-series data with trends.
   - Hyperparameters: `(p, d, q)` (order of the model).

2. **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):**
   - Captures seasonal patterns (e.g., weekly or yearly seasonality).
   - Hyperparameters: `(p, d, q) x (P, D, Q, s)`, where `s` is the seasonal period.

#### **Machine Learning Models**

1. **Linear Regression:**
   - Baseline model for understanding linear relationships between predictors and sales.

2. **Random Forest Regressor:**
   - Captures complex relationships and interactions between features.
   - Handles nonlinear patterns and feature importance.

3. **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):**
   - Effective for large datasets and time-series-like regression problems.
   - Provides better performance through gradient boosting.

4. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**
   - Deep learning model specifically designed for sequential data.
   - Captures long-term dependencies in time series.

### üß™ 4. Model Training and Evaluation

#### **Metrics for Evaluation**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**
  Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.  

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**
  Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.  

- **R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination):**
  Indicates how well the model explains the variability in the target variable.

### üìù 5. Model Implementation Steps

1. **ARIMA / SARIMA:**
   - Fit the model on the training data.
   - Forecast weekly sales for the test period.
   - Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.

2. **Linear Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost:**
   - Prepare features and target variables.
   - Train the model on the training set.
   - Predict weekly sales on the test set.
   - Evaluate the predictions using the same metrics.

3. **LSTM:**
   - Prepare the data by reshaping it for sequential input.
   - Define the LSTM network architecture.
   - Train the model and evaluate performance.

### üìà 6. Model Comparison

- Compare the performance of all models using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ scores.
- Identify the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

---

### üìä 7. Visualization and Insights

#### **Visualize Predictions:**
- Plot actual vs predicted sales for each model.

#### **Feature Importance:**
- For machine learning models, analyze which factors contribute most to sales predictions.

#### **Residual Analysis:**
- Evaluate residuals (errors) to check for patterns or biases.

---

### üöÄ 8. Deployment and Conclusion

#### **Deploy the Best Model:**
- Deploy the selected model (e.g., using a web interface like Streamlit or Flask).

#### **Conclusion:**
- Summarize findings and recommendations for Walmart based on the analysis and predictions.
